# Workshop Management System
The purpose of this solution is to automate the key business processes associated with the operation of a vehicle repair workshop.

The intial effort will be focused primarily on modelling the various business objects that exist within the domain and the associations herein; thereafter shifting the focus to embedding the intrinsic business logic into each of these elements, and implementing the required functionality into this model.

The core functionality is planned to be delivered within the first few iterations following the modelling of the domain; thereafter, the subsequent functionality will be rolled out based on the product owners priorization.
